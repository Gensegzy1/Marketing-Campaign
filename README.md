# Superhero U Digital Marketing Campaign Optimization
### Maximizing Cost Efficiency and Engagement in Facebook Ads

### Introduction

As part of the Excelerate Internship Program, our team worked on optimizing the Superhero U digital marketing campaign, which aimed to engage students, educators, and principals through Facebook ads. Our objective was to analyze 11 ad campaigns and determine which ones were cost-effective and which needed to be discontinued or optimized.

To achieve this, we evaluated key digital marketing metrics, such as Cost Per Click (CPC), Cost Per Result (CPR), Reach, Impressions, and Unique Link Clicks (ULC). The findings helped us identify high-performing and underperforming campaigns, allowing for better budget allocation and future strategy improvements.

### Data Collection

### Key Metrics Evaluated
To assess campaign performance, we focused on the following five key metrics, each providing valuable insight into the effectiveness and cost efficiency of the ads.
#### 1. Cost Per Click (CPC) & Cost Per Result (CPR) – Evaluating Cost Efficiency

CPC (Cost Per Click) measures the amount spent to get a single click on the ad. A lower CPC is desirable, as it means the campaign generates clicks at a lower cost.

CPR (Cost Per Result) represents the cost of achieving a specific campaign goal, such as a sign-up, download, or website visit. A lower CPR indicates better cost efficiency in achieving meaningful engagement.

##### Findings:

Campaign 3 (Australia) and Campaign 10 (UK) had the highest CPC and CPR, making them the least cost-effective.

Campaign 3: ₹23.76 CPC | ₹69.32 CPR

Campaign 10: ₹22.36 CPC | ₹55.95 CPR

Campaign 8 had the lowest CPC at ₹1.04, making it the most affordable for generating clicks.

Campaign 6 had the lowest CPR at ₹2.11, meaning it provided the best cost efficiency in driving engagement.

#### 2. Reach & Impressions – Measuring Ad Visibility

Reach refers to the number of unique users who saw the ad at least once.

Impressions measure the total number of times an ad was displayed, including multiple views by the same user.

##### Findings:

Campaigns with higher reach and impressions generally had better engagement, but cost efficiency varied.

Campaigns 3 and 10 had low reach despite high costs, reducing their overall effectiveness.

#### 3. Unique Link Clicks (ULC) – Understanding Audience Engagement

ULC measures the number of distinct users who clicked on the ad link, giving insight into how many people were genuinely interested in the content.

##### Findings:

Campaigns with low ULC but high costs were less effective in driving engagement.

Campaign 3 and Campaign 10 showed low ULC relative to their costs, making them candidates for discontinuation.

### Conclusion & Recommendations

Discontinue Campaigns 3 (Australia) and 10 (UK) due to high costs and low engagement.

Reallocate budget to high-performing campaigns like Campaigns 6 and 8 to maximize efficiency.

Future campaigns should focus on balancing cost efficiency with audience engagement to achieve better ROI.

This project provided valuable insights into digital marketing optimization, demonstrating how data-driven decision-making can enhance campaign effectiveness while reducing costs. Moving forward, refining audience segmentation and budget allocation will be crucial for maximizing campaign performance.
